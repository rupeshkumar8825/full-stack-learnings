// DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SETTIMEOUT AND SETINTERVAL 
// the basic difference between them is that the settimeout is used to run a piece of code after some delay.
// but in case of the setinterval we can run the same piece of code after each interval 
// we can also clear the setinterval and the settimeout functions to stop executing the same stuff for this purpose
